You were on a camping trip with your family up at your parents cabin 
in Maine. Everything was great you went swimming, made smores, and went fishing. You had two days left in your trip
when your son saw a bear! Nothing that crazy for Maine but this bear was insane. He looked crazy in the eyes. Then two
more bears that looked just as crazy appeared also.
You remember your parents telling you about the power plant problem. A week ago there was a power plant that had a spill
of toxic waste. You wondered if the bears got to close to the nuclear spillage.
That's when your instincts kick in. You run with your son to the house while the bears chase you. You make it back in.
Luckily your parents house has a garage so you decide to pack up and leave with your family. Bears are all around the
house maybe dozens. They are hostile also. They attack the doors and windows.
Luckily you and your family escape the killer bears, or so you thought. As your driving on the remote roads of Maine,
bears come at of no where attacking your car. You have to escape. The bears are slowly breaking the car. If the car
breaks you're sure to die.

SAVE YOUR FAMILY!
